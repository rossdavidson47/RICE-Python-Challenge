In this folder are the exercises for the Python homework for the Rice Bootcamp, May 2020.
There are folders for each exercise:
-   PyBank
-   PyPoll

Each folder contains main.py, which is the primary code to run.
In some folders there is other code, achieving the same result by different method.
Each folder contains a Resources folder, with source data. The code reaches for that path.
Each folder contains an Analysis folder. The code prints results to that path.
